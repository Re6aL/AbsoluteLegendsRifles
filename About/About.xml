<description>Abso-Lutely legendary rifles are
WIP (not so much) PLAYABLE for now.

[Combat Extended Only]
14(why so many!) guns, most of them are snipers but there're also carbin, shotguns and just.. rifles you know. I had a lot of fun drawing these but some textures (only the ugly ones) are super-fast remade reference images.
have fun.
TO DO: create sounds, edit code, re-make some textures.

RunAndGun patch also present and it forbids runngunning with most of the guns, but "Lezagun" for example can RnG because of its light weight, thats how cool Lezagun is.

OPEN FOR COLLABORATION ON THIS
i am practicing in Illustrator drawing different guns, not aimed on something specifically just stuff that i like. Why not turn it into beautiful mod?
snipers are my favourite guys in RimWorld. i would love every sniper to have my beautiful gun with them.

Any Help or feedback is Highly appreciated.
cant figure out how to properly make my own CE Ammo sets with custom icons.
Really need help with this.</description>
