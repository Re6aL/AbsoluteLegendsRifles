<description>Abso-Lutely legendary rifles are
WIP (not so much) PLAYABLE for now.

 OPEN FOR COLLABORATION ON THIS
i am practicing in Illustrator drawing different guns, not aimed on something specifically just stuff that i like. Why not turn it into beautiful mod?
snipers are my favourite guys in RimWorld. i would love every sniper to have my beautiful gun with them.

Any Help or feedback is Highly appreciated.

Really need help with this.</description>
