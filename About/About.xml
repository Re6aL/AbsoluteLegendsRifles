<description>Abso-Lutely legendary rifles WIP testing now. [for now they all have same code]
[Combat Extended Only]

I am no coder nor programmer - imma draw textures!
Just a couple'o'guns I made for paractice illustrator.

OPEN FOR COLLABORATION
i am practicing drawing different textures, not aimed on something specifically just stuff that i like.
And i occasionally re-texture some mods that i like and use. (probably gonna share it someday)

RunAndGun patch also present and it forbids runngunning with most of the guns, but "Lezagun" for example can RnG because of its light weight, thats how cool Lezagun is.
I recommend always check RunAndGun SETTINGS to make sure its how you want.

TO DO here: create sounds, edit code, re-make some textures.

Any Help or feedback is Highly appreciated.
cant figure out how to properly make my own CE Ammo sets with custom icons.
Really need help with this.

you can use any textures you find here how you like, no fucks given))</description>
