<description>2 rifles [for now they have same code] [Combat Extended Only]
Lezagun drawn by my good friend Leza.

I am no coder nor programmer - imma draw textures!

OPEN FOR COLLABORATION
i am practicing drawing different textures, not aimed on something specifically just stuff that i like.
And i occasionally re-texture some mods that i like and use. (probably gonna share it someday)

RunAndGun - check RunAndGun SETTINGS.

I cant figure out how to properly make my own CE Ammo for Anesthetic Gun Mod (tranquilizer gun)
Any Help or feedback is Highly appreciated.

you can use any textures you find here how you like, no fucks given))</description>
