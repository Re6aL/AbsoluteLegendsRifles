<description>Abso-Lutely legendary rifles WIP testing now. [for now they all have same code]
[Combat Extended Only] Just a couple'o'guns I made for paractice.

I am no coder nor programmer - imma draw textures!

OPEN FOR COLLABORATION
i am practicing drawing different textures, not aimed on something specifically just stuff that i like.
And i occasionally re-texture some mods that i like and use. (probably gonna share it someday)

RunAndGun - check RunAndGun SETTINGS to make sure its how you want. I suggest Leaving Lezagun rng enabled cause Lezagun in super cool.
TO DO in this mod: everything exept textures

Any Help or feedback is Highly appreciated.
I cant figure out how to properly make my own CE Ammo for Anesthetic Gun Mod (tranquilizer gun)

you can use any textures you find here how you like, no fucks given))</description>
